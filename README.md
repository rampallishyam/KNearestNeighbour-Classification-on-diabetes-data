# KNearestNeighbour-Classification-on-diabetes-data

 This code looks at the following diabetes data of the first row 

| Pregnancies | Glucose |BloodPressure      | SkinThickness | Insulin      | BMI | DiabetesPedigreeFunction      | Age | Outcome      | 
| --           | --     |--                | --            | --            | --| --                           | --  | --           |
| 6           | 148     |172                | 35            | 0            | 33.6| 627                           | 50  | 1            | 

I have implemented Knearest neighbour classifer present in sklearn and tried to train, predict and then test the algorithm on this data. Additionally, I computed the metrics such as accuracy, precision and f1-score.
